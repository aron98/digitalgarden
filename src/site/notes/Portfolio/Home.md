# Hello world ðŸš€

I'm Aron, a Software Developer, and I have 2 big hobbies:
- Playing and experimenting with Software Development and AI
- Thinking about business cases.
So I thought why not combine the two. I believe there is huge potential in creating not so small software services for businesses - hence the name - and even more so with coding AI tools being so advanced and developing so fast.
So this is my journal and portfolio.

# Portfolio
